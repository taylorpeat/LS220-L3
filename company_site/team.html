                <p>We're going to revisit our Space Design website and add more information about our team members. Our designer has come up with a common means of displaying more information as an overlay on the page content, called a modal. A modal acts like a separate sub-window of content that can be closed in order to return to the main content, all without leaving the page. These always use CSS positioning to place the modal and an optional overlay element over the top of the content. The overlay acts as a blocking element to prevent interacting with the page underneath the modal. It is good practice to have at least a close link and a close action bound to clicking on the overlay that will remove the modal and the overlay.</p>
